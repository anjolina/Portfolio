Hi, I'm Anjolina Pradhan, an 18-year-old Computer Engineering student passionate about technology, creativity, and storytelling.

I enjoy building technical projects, exploring AI, and creating aesthetic lifestyle content on YouTube. I love combining logic with creativity — whether it's coding a project or capturing peaceful moments through videography.

I believe in individuality, growth, and constantly improving myself — academically and creatively.
